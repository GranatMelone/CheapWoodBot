# Development and Contributing 

## Getting Setup
To get setup, first clone this repository and follow the relevant instructions from the [Official Discord Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started).

## Running the Bot 
- Invite the bot to a test server, if you're not already in one.
- Using `npm run start` will start the application on `localhost:3000`. 
- You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to export this functionality remotely. Run `ngrok http 3000` to export this port remotely and start testing
- Once this URL is generated, you need to add the URL to the `Interactions Endpoint URL` on the app development portal
